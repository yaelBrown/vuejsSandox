  Directives - special token in the markup that tells the library to do something to a DOM element
    v-on:input - has to be es5
    v-once: - Stick to initial value (read only)
    v-bind:href - binds data dynamically
    v-html - render html code and not escape it
      Does expose you to XSS

  {{}} - syntax is called Interpolation or String Interpolation
